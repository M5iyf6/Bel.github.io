                <p class="tour__desc">
                    Another dish that Belarusian cuisine is famous for is dumplings. To prepare them, first onion and potatoes are manually rubbed on the smallest grater (yes, Belarusians are hardworking people). Then the mixture is squeezed through gauze and then an egg, salt and a little wheat flour are added to it. Next, balls with diameters of about 5-6 cm are formed from the dough and boiled in salted water. In Belarus, dumplings are served with sour cream and sprinkled with chopped fresh herbs.

                <p class="tour__desc">
                    Almost every foreign guest praises the bread of Belarus. In ancient times, it was baked in real ovens without the use of yeast. The dough was fermented on "roshchyn" - a small portion of dough from the previous baking. The composition included rye flour, salt and water, and it was literally kneaded with fists. Before going to the oven, a cross was always drawn on the prepared piece of dough. A loaf is considered perfectly baked when the steam from it goes straight up. Such bread cannot be tasted abroad!

                    Those who are not familiar with the peculiarities of the national Belarusian cuisine are moved by this name. But in fact, this is the name of a strong drink, which is based on alcohol or vodka with the addition of honey and spices such as cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, black and red hot peppers. The tincture is strong, but very fragrant. We recommend to all adults to taste!
